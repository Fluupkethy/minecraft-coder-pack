Things required to run:

- The shell scripts in the scripts directory need to be moved into the root
  directory of MCP before using them:
  mv scripts/*.sh .
- wine to run jad. We know, there are linux binaries of jad BUT those are
  v1.5.8e, we need 1.5.8g
- python to run some of the tools
- minecraft.jar, lwjgl jars, and the linux version of the natives, these can
  be found in your home dir under ".minecraft/bin", the entire bin folder
  itself should be copied into the jars folder

  After moving the scripts and confirming that wine and python are available run
the following command in the MCP root directory:
  bash ./cleanup.sh

  On the first run this will confirm the correct permissions for all scripts,
and check that all required directories are created.
  After this has been done you can run any commands by using ./cleanup.sh
./decompile.sh etc
